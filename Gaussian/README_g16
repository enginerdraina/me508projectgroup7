This is an example input script for Gaussian.
In order to run this input. you must delete all of the comments,
otherwise you may encounter an error.

For more info on keywords (like Opt or SP which is what we will use)
or other input parameters, refer to the Gaussian documentation.

==== CREATE FILE ====
To create an input file:
   $ emacs filename.com

To save the file, type ctrl+x+s
To close the file, type ctrl+x+c

You can use your fav text editor, but mine is emacs.

==== EXAMPLE INPUT ====
%NProcShared=2		! Number of processors used. We will use b/w 8-16 for MOFs
%mem = 8GB		! allocate memory
%chk=example.chk	! checkpoint in case calculation dies
#n B3LYP/6-31G(d) Opt	! B3LYP = functional, 6-31g* is basis. Opt is keyword for optimize
   		  	! blank line, must stay blank
 Example input script   ! must always include a title or calc will fail
 	       		! blank line, must stay blank
0 1			! charge and multiplicity, will change for MOF.
C         -2.87209        2.01374       -0.03500   	! atom, then coordinates
O         -4.06686        1.96995        0.00643
O         -1.67730        2.05721       -0.07666
! leave some blank lines after this or you may get an error.

==== RUNNING ====

To submit the calculation, run:

   $ qsub submit.sh

To track if your calculation is queued (qw), running (r), or dead:

   $ qstat -u lclemens [replace with your user]
  
To track the progress of your calculation, you can run:

   $ tail filename.log

If it is running, you can see that. If it failed, you will see an
error termination message. When your job finishes *successfully*, your
file will end with a random quote followed by the compute time of the calculation.

==== ENERGY CONVERGENCE ====

To track the convergence progress of the calculation, you can type

   $ grep Force filename.log
   $ grep Displacement filename.log

Force will converge slower than displacement, but you can track
your progress for a long SCF convergence.

To find the minimum energy in your output, you can run:

   $ grep SCF filename.log

The minimum energy will be the last SCF energy in the list.
