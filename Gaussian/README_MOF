This is documentation for how to run your MOF calculations.
We will cover the setup, through calculation submission.

==== VESTA ====
VESTA has its own crystallography database. You can find it by going to File >
Search Database. When you choose a MOF, VESTA will tell you how many atoms it
contains. Let's aim for 100-130 atoms.

Remove any atoms in the pores with the "Select" tool (s). Make sure you do not
have "Show only asymmetric unit" selected, as you will not get the full unit
cell. When you have just your unit cell, confirm it looks the same as the CCDC
preview, then export the file as xyz.

==== AVOGADRO ====
For this next step, you will need Avogadro. I know I said it's buggy, but it
should not be for this next step.

Load your xyz into Avogadro, then go to Build > Add Hydrogens

You need to be careful about a few things here. Metallic bonds tend to be too
long for Avogadro to interpret, so it will not show those bonds and instead
accidentally add H to stuff that should be coordinated to your metal center.
Try to connect your bonds to your metal center before adding H by using the
Draw Settings tool.

Secondly, you need to make sure any double/triple bonded atoms do not get H
added. For example, if you have a double bonded terminal oxygen, you can't have
H added there. Oxygen only likes to have two bonds. Any erronious non-bonding
or added H can be corrected easily! Avogadro also sometimes struggles to
recognize double bonds. This is okay, because we are not giving any bond info
to Gaussian HOWEVER if we miss a double bond and then add H, we are giving the
wrong info to Gaussian, and the calcualtion will not be correct. So, don't
worry if you don't see a double bond where there should be one, but DO worry
if it added a hydrogen where it should not have.

Your unit cell must be capped with hydrogren, or your calculation will not come
out correctly.

==== CHARGES ====
This part will probably be the most complicated. Your ligand should be neutral,
but you will have a collection of cations from your metal center. For example,
when Zn has 6 bonds (octahedral), it has a 2+ charge. If your ligand (thing
attached to metal centers) is neutral, then your charge is 2 times however
many Zn are in your unit cell.

If your ligand has something like an SO4 attached to it, that has a charge of
2-. To find our overall charge, we have to include positive and negative
charges.

Let's say your unit cell has 4 Zn, and 2 SO4. That makes your overall charge

      4(+2) + 2(-2)
      = 8 - 4
      = 4

This means in your .com file, you will change your charge to 4 in the charge
and multiplicity section.

==== SPIN ====
I think spin is irrelevant to explain for our project. Start by leaving your
spin as 1. Gaussian will throw an error immediately if your charge/spin
combination is wrong. If 1 doesn't work, the next number you want to try is 3.
If that doesn't work, use 2. If none of those work, we have a problem and you
should get in contact with me. Remember, the way to tell you have an error is
by checking to see if your calculation dies right after it starts running.

Use the command:
  $ tail g16.err

And if your charge/spin multiplicity is wrong, it will tell you the combination
is not allowed.

==== BASIS SET ====
We will be using what is referred to as a "split basis" where the light atoms
get a gaussian-type basis (6-31G or something similar, and the transition
metals get an effective core potential, LANL2DZ. I have the set up for this in
the example .com file

What you will want to change is the atoms. My MOF has sulfur and calcium, but
yours probably won't. You want to change C H O S to your light atoms, and Ca
to your transition metal.

We use the split basis because the gaussian basis sets are limited to certain
atoms, typically not including heavy atoms. The split basis will give us a more
accurate calculation.

==== SUBMIT ====
Once you get rid of my coordinates (ctrl+k will delete a whole line at a time),
you can paste yours in. After you update your title, charge and multiplicity,
and atoms in your split basis, you should be good to run!

In the .sh script, do not modify the processors or memory, but you should
replace the .com and .log with your file names.
